今次企劃集結一系列精選作品，希望令大家溫故知新。
以下係簡單既介紹。</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h2 id="兩年多了">兩年多了</h2>
<p>唔經唔覺，呀虧嘅禿頭獅子形象已面世兩年有多。
自面世以來，因其可愛、貼地、多變且無厘頭嘅形象深受推友喜愛。
佢係好多推友嘅謬斯，佢嘅存在可以為推友帶來源源不絕嘅靈感。</p>

<h2 id="感謝">感謝</h2>
<p>喺短短兩年之間，眾推友以呀虧為主角所創作嘅作品已有數百份，平均每日就有一份作品面世。
2022年年中，一班喜愛虧獅嘅推友組成「國立呀虧美術館委員會」，希望將推友創作嘅呀虧作品集結成冊。
從開始籌備到本書發佈經歷N個月，呢本集結咗畫師同委員會成員心血嘅結晶終於順利面世。
係呢度要感謝各位有關人士嘅配合。</p>

<h2 id="概念">概念</h2>
<p>今次紀念書冊以「模擬推友參觀美術館」為創作概念，但係佢嘅本質係一本畫冊，
裏面分主題收錄唔同畫師及推友所創作與呀虧相關嘅作品，其中包括九鳥所繪嘅歷史人物主題、社畜主題，眾推友合作嘅愛麗絲主題、食物主題等。
讀者打開書睇到售票處開始會被吸入書內，化身參觀美術館嘅遊客，
購票後根據委員會安排好嘅參觀路線，喺導賞員呀鳩嘅帶領之下欣賞展品。
美術館內設有呀虧主題咖啡店及禮品點，供遊客休息及購買紀念品。</p>

<p>衷心希望諸位可以享受今次嘅參觀！</p>

<h3 id="甩毛獅嘅由來">甩毛獅嘅由來</h3>
<p>呀虧原本係一隻綠色恐龍，因喜愛獅子又得畫師賜小獅子頭像而決定改變種族。呀虧最初變種嗰陣係一隻毛囊健康、頭毛濃密嘅可愛幼獅。佢變禿嘅真正原由因年代久遠及資料缺失難以考證。</p>

<p>根據現存資料顯示，原因有兩個版本：</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    用錯洗頭水<br />
    用錯洗頭水搞到全身甩毛，洗頭水威力強大，將毛囊完全破壞導致生唔返啲毛。佢而家兩鬢嘅頭毛其實係假狗嚟。甩毛後嘅虧其實唔係禿頭獅子，而係光頭獅子。

    慘被推友剃毛<br />
    同推友愉快咁玩耍嘅時候，因為太臭串而畀貪玩嘅推友熊熊用剃毛刀剃走咗頭頂嘅毛，剃過毛嘅頭皮因不可抗因素就算生返毛都會自動再甩過，後尾慢慢變成常態就再都生唔返。<br />

<p>雖然唔知以上邊個傳說先係呀虧變禿嘅真正成因，但可知嘅係最初嘅甩毛虧畫像乃出自推友尺尺之手，專門研究呀虧變禿嘅學者免免相信推友尺尺同呀虧變禿有直接關係。</p>

If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>

<p>As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using.</p>

<h2 id="special-formatting">Special formatting</h2>

<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li><del>strike through</del></li>
  <li>==highlight==</li>
  <li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-code-blocks">Writing code blocks</h2>

<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/8.jpg" alt="walking" /></p>

<h2 id="reference-lists">Reference lists</h2>

<p>The quick brown jumped over the lazy.</p>

<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>

<h2 id="full-html">Full HTML</h2>

<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>

Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>

As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Tree of Codes</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/tree-of-codes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tree of Codes" /><published>2019-01-27T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/tree-of-codes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/tree-of-codes/"><![CDATA[<p>The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter.</p>

<p>As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original — which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother — is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.</p>
